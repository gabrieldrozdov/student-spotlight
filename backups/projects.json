In this project, we’ll travel through time to explore how web technology and design have evolved side-by-side.</p><p>Students begin by selecting an article. Then, they typeset that article as a website three times — using technologies from the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. Finally, they create a homepage that links all three versions of the article together.</p>",
